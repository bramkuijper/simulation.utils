Description: This package contains various tools to facilitate running
numerical or individual-based simulations on your computer. The function
make.batch.file() produces a bash shell script (a batch file) that allows
you to run a list of different simulations. Next, the function aggregate.sims()
allows you to aggregrate data from simulation output
